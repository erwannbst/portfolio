A dynamic LED strip display integrated behind my wall-mounted surfboard that visualizes real-time tide and wave conditions. 🏄‍♂️🌊

The display changes color based on the tide level - transitioning from yellow at low tide to deep blue at high tide. When the waves are firing and conditions are perfect, the LEDs blink to let me know it's time to grab my board!

This project combines my passion for surfing with electronics, creating an ambient display that's both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The LEDs are hidden behind the surfboard mount, creating a subtle glow effect that doubles as room lighting while keeping me updated on surf conditions at a glance.
