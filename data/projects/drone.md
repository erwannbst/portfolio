As I was at the end of my high school, I wanted to learn about drones by building one. It was a lot of fun to build and to fly. I had to learn a lot about electronics and programming to make it work. The software is based on Betaflight.

The electronic part was the most challenging. I had to learn about ESC, motors, batteries, and a lot of other things. I also had to solder and properly use a multimeter, before having start my electronic studies.

I then took part in [a competition with the association Anjou Drone Racer](https://www.ouest-france.fr/pays-de-la-loire/maine-et-loire/angers-pilotes-de-drones-ils-realisent-le-reve-d-icare-680a2c4c-dca4-11e9-8deb-0cc47a644868). Unfortunately, a soldering went wrong, it burnt and crashed. I still have to fix it.

Thanks to another pilot, I have been able to participate with its backup drone and ended up 9th over 14, here is [the leaderboard](https://chronomatch.fr/event/qualifrecap.php?event=186)
