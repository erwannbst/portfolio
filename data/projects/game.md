Starting with a small school project with a friend, we ended up building a real-time two player game. The whole app is written in JavaScript with Node.js and Socket.io. We used the awesome platform Glitch to develop and host the app, you can check it out [here](https://age-of-ampecqueur.glitch.me/).
